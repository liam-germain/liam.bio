Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Liam Germain and I am a senior at the University of Pennsylvania. I have always been passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it brings. That's why I love to code!

With every line I type,
I create something new,
Bringing my ideas to life
Is what I love to do.

Whether it's building a website,
Or crafting a clever app,
There's nothing quite like the feeling
Of solving a coding trap.

So take a look around,
And see what I can do,
I hope you enjoy my work
As much as I enjoy coding for you!

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find something here that interests you. If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me through the contact page.

Best regards,
